# Static Site Generators

Generate formatted pages based on some predefined basic 
formatting (i.e., Markdown)

Popular Generators ():
- GatsbyJS (Javascript, React)
- Jekyll (Ruby, Rails)
- Next.js (Javascript, React)
- Hugo (Golang)

These ones are great for a lot of different applications, 
have a lot of templates (i.e., for a blog, portfolio, etc.)

Other Generators:
- Docusaurus (Javascript, React)

Docusaurus excells greatly in API documentation sites, it 
has a lot of features and handles assets better than 
templates you may find in GatsbyJS for example. It's only 
issue is lack of customization out of the box.
